          <h1 class="career mg-top-btm">EARLY LIFE AND CRICKET CAREER</h1>
          <p class="career-desc">
            Khan was born into an affluent Pashtun family in Lahore and was
            educated at elite schools in Pakistan and the United Kingdom,
            including the Royal Grammar School in Worcester and Aitchison
            College in Lahore. There were several accomplished cricket players
            in his family, including two elder cousins, Javed Burki and Majid
            Khan, who both served as captains of the Pakistani national team.
            Imran Khan played cricket in Pakistan and the United Kingdom in his
            teens and continued playing while studying philosophy, politics, and
            economics at the University of Oxford. Khan played his first match
            for Pakistan’s national team in 1971, but he did not take a
            permanent place on the team until after his graduation from Oxford
            in 1976.<br /><br />
            By the early 1980s Khan had distinguished himself as an exceptional
            bowler and all-rounder, and he was named captain of the Pakistani
            team in 1982. Khan’s athletic talent and good looks made him a
            celebrity in Pakistan and England, and his regular appearances at
            fashionable London nightclubs provided fodder for the British
            tabloid press. In 1992 Khan achieved his greatest athletic success
            when he led the Pakistani team to its first World Cup title,
            defeating England in the final. He retired that same year, having
            secured a reputation as one of the greatest cricket players in
            history.<br /><br />
            After 1992 Khan remained in the public eye as a philanthropist. He
            experienced a religious awakening, embracing Sufi mysticism and
            shedding his earlier playboy image. In one of his philanthropic
            endeavours, Khan acted as the primary fund-raiser for the Shaukat
            Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, a specialized cancer hospital in
            Lahore, which opened in 1994. The hospital was named after Khan’s
            mother, who had died of cancer in 1985.
          </p>
          <h1 class="career mg-top-btm">ENTRY INTO POLITICS</h1>
          <p class="career-desc">
            After his retirement from cricket, Khan became an outspoken critic
            of government mismanagement and corruption in Pakistan. He founded
            his own political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Pakistan Justice
            Movement; PTI), in 1996. In national elections held the following
            year, the newly formed party won less than 1 percent of the vote and
            failed to win any seats in the National Assembly, but it fared
            slightly better in the 2002 elections, winning a single seat that
            Khan filled. Khan maintained that vote rigging was to blame for his
            party’s low vote totals. In October 2007 Khan was among a group of
            politicians who resigned from the National Assembly, protesting
            Pres. Pervez Musharraf’s candidacy in the upcoming presidential
            election. In November Khan was briefly imprisoned during a crackdown
            against critics of Musharraf, who had declared a state of emergency.
            The PTI condemned the state of emergency, which ended in
            mid-December, and boycotted the 2008 national elections to protest
            Musharraf’s rule.<br /><br />
            In spite of the PTI’s struggles in elections, Khan’s populist
            positions found support, especially among young people. He continued
            his criticism of corruption and economic inequality in Pakistan and
            opposed the Pakistani government’s cooperation with the United
            States in fighting militants near the Afghan border. He also
            launched broadsides against Pakistan’s political and economic
            elites, whom he accused of being Westernized and out of touch with
            Pakistan’s religious and cultural norms.<br /><br />
            The protests failed to oust Sharif, but suspicions of corruption
            were amplified when the Panama Papers linked his family to offshore
            holdings. Khan organized a new set of protests in late 2016 but
            called them off at the last minute after the Supreme Court agreed to
            open an investigation. The investigation disqualified Sharif from
            holding public office in 2017, and he was forced to resign from
            office. Khan, meanwhile, was also revealed to have had offshore
            holdings but, in a separate case, was not disqualified by the
            Supreme Court.
          </p>
          <h1 class="career mg-top-btm">POLITICAL ASCENT</h1>
          <p class="career-desc">
            In the months leading up to the legislative elections scheduled for
            early 2013, Khan and his party drew large crowds at rallies and
            attracted the support of several veteran politicians from Pakistan’s
            established parties. Further evidence of Khan’s rising political
            fortunes came in the form of an opinion poll in 2012 that found him
            to be the most popular political figure in Pakistan.<br /><br />
            Just days before legislative elections in May 2013, Khan injured his
            head and back when he fell from a platform at a campaign rally. He
            appeared on television from his hospital bed hours later to make a
            final appeal to voters. The elections produced the PTI’s highest
            totals yet, but the party still won less than half the number of
            seats won by the Pakistan Muslim League–Nawaz (PML-N), led by Nawaz
            Sharif. Khan accused the PML-N of rigging the elections. After his
            calls for an investigation went unmet, he and other opposition
            leaders led four months of protests in late 2014 in order to
            pressure Sharif to step down.<br /><br />
            Elections were held the following year, in July 2018. Khan ran on a
            platform of fighting corruption and poverty, even as he had to fight
            off accusations that he was too cozy with the military
            establishment. The PTI won a plurality of seats in the National
            Assembly, allowing Khan to seek a coalition with independent members
            of the parliament. He became prime minister on August 18.

            Gilgit, town in Gilgit-Baltistan, part of the Pakistani-administered
            sector of the Kashmir region, in the northern Indian subcontinent.
            It is situated in the Karakoram Range in a narrow valley on the
            Gilgit River at its confluence with the Hunza River and about 20
            miles (32 km) upstream from its confluence with the Indus River. The
            town was once a Buddhist centre; now, as in earlier days, it serves
            as a frontier station for local tribal areas. Its economy is mainly
            agricultural, with wheat, corn (maize), and barley as the main
            crops. Tourism, notably trekking and mountaineering in the
            Karakorams, is growing in importance. The main route from Gilgit
            through the mountains to Mansehra in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is
            the Karakoram Highway (completed in 1978); the town has a small
            airport. Gilgit is the only town of any size in the region. Pop.
            (1998 prelim.) 8,200.

            K2, Chinese Qogir Feng, also called Mount Godwin Austen, called
            locally Dapsang or Chogori, the world’s second highest peak (28,251
            feet [8,611 metres]), second only to Mount Everest. K2 is located in
            the Karakoram Range and lies partly in a Chinese-administered
            enclave of the Kashmir region within the Uygur Autonomous Region of
            Xinjiang, China, and partly in the Gilgit-Baltistan portion of
            Kashmir under the administration of Pakistan.

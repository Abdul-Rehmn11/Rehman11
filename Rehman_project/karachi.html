          <p class="karachi-desc">
            Karachi was a small fishing village when a group of traders moved
            there in the early 18th century from the decaying port of Kharak
            Bandar nearby. Besides the natural protection against monsoon
            storms, Manora Head furnished an excellent site for the defense of
            the harbour, and the Talpura amīrs who gained Karachi from the khān
            of Kalāt in 1795 erected a permanent fort on it. The settlement
            expanded rapidly and was already of significance when it was
            captured in 1839 by the British, who annexed it in 1842, together
            with the province of Sindh. It then became an army headquarters for
            the British and also began to develop from a fishing village into
            the principal port for the Indus River region.<br /><br />
            In 1843 a river-steamer service was introduced between Karachi and
            Multān, about 500 miles up the Indus. Port facilities were improved
            from 1854 onward. In 1861 a railway was built from Karachi to Kotri,
            90 miles upstream on the right bank of the Indus, opposite
            Hyderabad. In 1864 direct telegraph communications were established
            with London and with the interior. With the opening of the Suez
            Canal in 1869, the importance of Karachi grew, and it became a
            full-fledged seaport. By 1873 it possessed an efficient and
            well-managed harbour.<br /><br />
            Karachi was connected directly with the hinterland when the railway
            line was extended from Kotri in 1878 to join the Delhi-Punjab
            railway system at Multān. In 1886 the Karachi Port Trust was
            established as the port authority, and between 1888 and 1910 the
            East Wharf—186,000 feet in length—was constructed. When the Punjab
            emerged as the granary of India in the 1890s, Karachi became the
            region’s principal outlet. By 1914 it had become the largest grain
            exporting port of the British Empire.<br /><br />
            After World War I, manufacturing and service industries were
            installed. By 1924 an aerodrome had been built, and Karachi became
            the main airport of entry to India. The city became the provincial
            capital of Sindh in 1936.<br /><br />
            With the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Karachi became not only the
            capital and premier port of the new country but also a centre for
            industry, business, and administration. Although Rawalpindi became
            the interim capital in 1959, before the capital permanently moved to
            Islamabad in 1969, Karachi maintained its preeminence as Pakistan’s
            business and industrial hub. In a development typical of many
            postcolonial megacities, this premier economic status subsequently
            contributed to an enormous increase in Karachi’s population, as a
            huge influx of job-seeking immigrants from rural areas nearly
            doubled the city’s size in the final two decades of the 20th
            century. With the city’s infrastructure already overburdened to the
            breaking point, fully one-third of these new arrivals were forced to
            take up residence in urban shantytowns known as katchi abadis, which
            ordinarily lacked power, running water, or sanitation. The delivery
            of basic city services remained an ongoing problem for Karachi into
            the 21st century.

          <p class="karachi-desc">
            The city, which once comprised primarily Sindhis and the Baloch, is
            now made up of several ethnic groups. The most numerous are
            Urdu-speaking muhājirs, Muslims who left India as a result of the
            1947 partition. Punjabis and Pashtuns have sizable communities in
            Karachi as well. There are also communities of Black African
            ancestry, called “Makranis” and “Sheedis,” whose ancestors were
            taken from Africa to Karachi in the Indian slave trade.

          <p class="career-desc">
            Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He
            displayed an early talent for computers and entrepreneurship. At age
            12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine. In
            1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa
            because he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory
            military service and because he sought the greater economic
            opportunities available in the United States.
          </p>
          <h1 class="career mg-top-btm">PAYPAL AND SPACEX</h1>
          <p class="career-desc">
            Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992
            he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia,
            where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in
            1997. He enrolled in graduate school in physics at Stanford
            University in California, but he left after only two days because he
            felt that the Internet had much more potential to change society
            than work in physics. In 1995 he founded Zip2, a company that
            provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999
            Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307
            million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company,
            X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in transferring
            money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5
            billion.<br /><br />
            Musk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to
            become a multiplanet species. However, he was dissatisfied with the
            great expense of rocket launchers. In 2002 he founded Space
            Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets.
            Its first two rockets were the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and
            the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were designed to
            cost much less than competing rockets. A third rocket, the Falcon
            Heavy (first launched in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds
            (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly twice as much as its largest
            competitor, the Boeing Company’s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the
            cost. SpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the
            Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy–Starship system. The Super Heavy first
            stage would be capable of lifting 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) to low
            Earth orbit. The payload would be the Starship, a spacecraft
            designed for providing fast transportation between cities on Earth
            and building bases on the Moon and Mars. SpaceX also developed the
            Dragon spacecraft, which carries supplies to the International Space
            Station (ISS). Dragon can carry as many as seven astronauts, and it
            had a crewed flight carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert
            Behnken to the ISS in 2020. The first test flights of the Super
            Heavy–Starship system launched in 2020. In addition to being CEO of
            SpaceX, Musk was also chief designer in building the Falcon rockets,
            Dragon, and Starship.

          <h1 class="career mg-top-btm">TESLA</h1>
          <p class="career-desc">
            Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars,
            and in 2004 he became one of the major funders of Tesla Motors
            (later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by
            entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In 2006 Tesla
            introduced its first car, the Roadster, which could travel 245 miles
            (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles,
            which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports
            car that could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than
            four seconds. In 2010 the company’s initial public offering raised
            about $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S
            sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance
            and design. The company won further praise for its Model X luxury
            SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a less-expensive
            vehicle, went into production in 2017 and became the best-selling
            electric car of all time.<br /><br />
            Dissatisfied with the projected cost ($68 billion) of a high-speed
            rail system in California, Musk in 2013 proposed an alternate faster
            system, the Hyperloop, a pneumatic tube in which a pod carrying 28
            passengers would travel the 350 miles (560 km) between Los Angeles
            and San Francisco in 35 minutes at a top speed of 760 miles (1,220
            km) per hour, nearly the speed of sound. Musk claimed that the
            Hyperloop would cost only $6 billion and that, with the pods
            departing every two minutes on average, the system could accommodate
            the six million people who travel that route every year. However, he
            stated, between running SpaceX and Tesla, he could not devote time
            to the Hyperloop’s development.
          </p>
          <h1 class="career mg-top-btm">TWITTER</h1>
          <p class="career-desc">
            Musk joined the social media service Twitter in 2009, and, as
            @elonmusk, he became one of the most popular accounts on the site,
            with more than 85 million followers as of 2022. He expressed
            reservations about Tesla’s being publicly traded, and in August 2018
            he made a series of tweets about taking the company private at a
            value of $420 per share, noting that he had “secured funding.” (The
            value of $420 was seen as a joking reference to April 20, a day
            celebrated by devotees of cannabis.) The following month the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for securities
            fraud, alleging that the tweets were “false and misleading.” Shortly
            thereafter Tesla’s board rejected the SEC’s proposed settlement,
            reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign. However, the news
            sent Tesla stock plummeting, and a harsher deal was ultimately
            accepted. Its terms included Musk’s stepping down as chairman for
            three years, though he was allowed to continue as CEO; his tweets
            were to be preapproved by Tesla lawyers, and fines of $20 million
            for both Tesla and Musk were levied.<br /><br />
            Musk was critical of Twitter’s commitment to principles of free
            speech, in light of the company’s content-moderation policies. Early
            in April 2022, Twitter’s filings with the SEC disclosed that Musk
            had bought more than 9 percent of the company. Shortly thereafter
            Twitter announced that Musk would join the company’s board, but Musk
            decided against that and made a bid for the entire company, at a
            value of $54.20 a share, for $44 billion. Twitter’s board accepted
            the deal, which would make him sole owner of the company. Musk
            stated that his plans for the company included “enhancing the
            product with new features, making the algorithms open source to
            increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all
            humans.”

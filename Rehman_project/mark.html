          <h1 class="career mg-top-btm">CEO FACEBOOK</h1>
          <p class="career-desc">
            American computer programmer who was cofounder and CEO (2004– ) of
            Facebook, a social networking Web site. After attending Phillips
            Exeter Academy, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University in 2002.
            On February 4, 2004, he launched thefacebook.com (renamed Facebook
            in 2005), a directory in which fellow Harvard students entered their
            own information and photos into a template that he had devised.
            Within two weeks half of the student body had signed up.
            Zuckerberg’s roommates, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, helped
            him add features and make the site available to other campuses
            across the country. Facebook quickly became popular as registered
            users could create profiles, upload photos and other media, and keep
            in touch with friends. It differed from other social networking
            sites, however, in its emphasis on real names (and e-mail
            addresses), or “trusted connections.” It also laid particular
            emphasis on networking, with information disseminated not only to
            each individual’s network of friends but also to friends of
            friends—what Zuckerberg called the “social graph.”<br /><br />
            In the summer of 2004 the trio moved their headquarters to Palo
            Alto, California, where Zuckerberg talked venture capitalist Peter
            Thiel into giving them seed money. Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard
            to concentrate on the fledgling company, of which he became CEO and
            president. In May 2005 Facebook received its first major infusion of
            venture capital ($12.7 million). Four months later Facebook opened
            to registration by high-school students. Meanwhile, foreign colleges
            and universities also began to sign up, and by September 2006 anyone
            with an e-mail address could join a regional network based on where
            he or she lived. About that time Zuckerberg turned down a $1 billion
            buyout offer from Yahoo!, but in 2007 Facebook struck a deal with
            Microsoft in which the software company paid $240 million for a 1.6
            percent stake in Facebook; two years later Digital Sky Technologies
            purchased a 1.96 percent share for $200 million. In 2008
            Zuckerberg’s new worth was estimated at about $1.5 billion. After
            Facebook’s initial public offering (IPO) of stock in 2012,
            Zuckerberg’s net worth was estimated at more than $19 billion.

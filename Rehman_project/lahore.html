          <h1 class="lahore mg-top-btm">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h1>
          <p class="lahore-desc">
            The origin of Lahore can be traced back somewhere between 1st and
            7th centuries A.D. It is, however, inferred by historians that
            Lahore was actually founded by Loh e son of Rama, characterized as
            the Hindu god in Ramayana. According to Sir Robert Montgomery,
            Lahore rose to importance between 2nd and 4th centuries. According
            to the Greek geographer, Ptolemy, Lahore was founded somewhere at
            the end of the 1st century. According to the book ood-e-Aalamahore
            appeared as a town in 882 AD.<br /><br />
            The people of Lahore, when they want to emphasize the uniqueness of
            their town say "Lahore is Lahore". The traditional capital of Punjab
            for a thousand years, it had been the cultural center of Northern
            India extending from Peshawar to New Delhi. This preeminent position
            it holds in Pakistan as well. Lahore is the city of poets, artists
            and the center of film industry. It has the largest number of
            educational institutions in the country and some of the finest
            gardens in the continent.<br /><br />
            The city as we know it today, reached its peak of glory during the
            Moghul rulers, especially in the reign of Akbar the Great, who made
            it his capital. His son, Jehangir, is buried in its outskirts and
            his mausoleum is one of the places frequented by tourists and
            Lahorites alike. Close by is the mausoleum of the famous Moghul
            Empress, Nur Jehan, who is known for introducing the rose plant and
            for initiating several cultural movements in the Sub-Continent.<br /><br />
            Akbar the Great held his Court In Lahore for 14 years from 1584 to
            1598, and built the Lahore Fort, as well as the city walls which had
            12 gates. Some of these still survive. Jehangir and Shah Jehan, the
            builders of the Taj Mahal in Agra and the Shalamar Gardens in
            Srinagar and Lahore, built palaces and tombs. The last great Moghul
            Emperor, Aurangzeb (1838 - 1707) built Lahore's most famous
            monument, the great Badshahi Mosque. At that time the river Ravi,
            which now lies a few miles away from Lahore, touched the ramparts of
            the Fort and the Mosque. A stream still flaws there and is known as
            the"Old River". The Sikhs ruled it in the 18th and 19th centuries,
            and though it was their capital, they had a habit of damaging the
            Muslim monuments and took little interest in gardens. It is said
            that they took enough marble from the Moghul monuments of Lahore to
            build the Golden Temple at Amratsar twice over. Most of the gems
            that decorated the palaces and the forts were also taken out.

          <h1 class="lahore mg-top-btm">BRITISH</h1>
          <p class="lahore-desc">
            British were responsible for the desecration of many of Lahore's
            tombs and monuments. At one stage the Attorney General maintained an
            office at the Shah Chiragh Mosque, dak bungalows were built for the
            weekends at Shalamar Gardens. Anarkali's tomb was used as an office
            and later consecrated as a place of worship called St. Adrew's
            Church. It can also be conjectured that Lahore was an industrial
            center in the Moghul period. The famous guns which lie in front of
            the Central Museum and other places were molded in the foundries of
            Lahore. Their perfection shows that the industry was quite advanced.
            Within the walled city you may come across old Havelis or the
            spacious houses of the rich, which give you an inkling of the style
            of the rich and notables in the Moghul reign. Efforts are being made
            to preserve some of the buildings, along with their environments,
            but a great deal needs to be done to maintain them for posterity.<br /><br />
            The British during their reign (1849 -1947) compensated Lahore, by
            harmoniously combining Mughal, Gothic and Victorian styles of
            architecture. Victorian heritage is only next to Mughal monuments.
            The GPO and YMCA buildings built to commemorate the golden jubilee
            of Queen Victoria - an event marked by the construction of clock
            towers and monuments all over India. They built some important
            buildings, like the High Court. the Government College, the Museums,
            the National College of Arts, Montgomery Hall, Tollinton Market, the
            Punjab University (Old Campus) and the Provincial Assembly. At one
            end of The Mall stands the University - perhaps the largest center
            of education in Asia. The city has built a new Campus in the quieter
            environments on the Canal Bank, but the old University buildings are
            still functioning.<br /><br />
            Students from all over Pakistan come here to receive education.
            Their activities completely over shadow other aspects of the
            cultural life. Moti Masjid or Pearl Mosque beyond the audience hall
            was for the exclusive use of royal ladies carved from marble having
            the luster of pearls. Nearby "Naulakha", a marble pavilion is inlaid
            with floral motifs and precious gems. Sheesh Mahal (Palace of
            Mirrors) built in 1631 is the most richly decorated building inside
            Lahore Fort. it is named for the elaborate mosaic of convex mirrors
            set in Stucco work tracery and the gilded interior. Built by emperor
            Shah Jehan, for his empress and his harem, fretted marble work
            screens hiding the occupants from view. Lahore offers some
            delightful picnic spots. Tourists can find shady groves and green
            carpets at Shalamar Gardens, Jehangir's Tomb and the Jinnah Gardens,
            the Jallo Park the newly built lqbal Park and Changa Manga Forests.
            Boats can be hired at the river Ravi, or at Baradari, another of the
            river-side pleasure-houses built by the Mughals and an ideal place
            for relaxation.

            Lohawar is probably correct form of its original name. This name is

            Chronicles meaning “Fort of Loh”.
